Ook de burgers, koffie en smoothies die voorbij kwamen, zagen er goed uit. Drinken serveren ze met het blikje en mooie glazen. Prijs - kwaliteit echt prima. En ik hoorde de opmerking dat wat men niet op kreeg, dat ook mee naar huis genomen kon worden.\n\nDe sfeer is heel erg fijn. Lichte zachte inrichting, zachte stoffen stoelen. En de chef en bediening staan er met plezier. En dat je oprecht welkom bent, dat voelde ik.\n\nDe service was ook top. Door ziekte heb ik graag wat afstand van mensen en moet ik mijn eigen mes mee nemen omdat horecamessen vaak bot zijn. Hier werd niet moeilijk over gedaan, ik werd op mijn gemak gesteld en er werd rekening mee gehouden. Overigens zijn hun rvs messen hier heel scherp ‚úÖÔ∏è.

en gisteren een lunch genuttigd. Ik nam de wrap krokante kip. De wrap zelf was van bieten gemaakt en zag er mede daardoor mooi uit. De smaak viel helaas enorm tegen. De kipkrokant moest ik zoeken tussen de enorme hoeveelheid aan sla. Er waren welgeteld drie stukjes kipkrokant in de wrap verwerkt. De hoeveelheid aan groenvoer was onsmakelijk. Het geheel werd hierdoor zompig, daar de sla veel vocht bevatte en koelkast koud was, nauwelijks smaak had (geen dressing of anderzins) en de kipkrokant juist warm was. Kortom, het heeft niet gesmaakt. De bediening was vriendelijk, dat dan weer wel. Toen ik bij de bediening aangaf dat de hoeveelheid aan sla echt overdone was, knikte ze instemmend en liet weten het aan de keuken door te geven. Op de foto de sla die uit de wrap kwam die over was, ik had al veel van deze sla wel opgegeten. Mijn partner had de club sandwich, deze was redelijk te noemen. Hij vond het brood droog en de saus te min. Jammer, we kwamen hier vroeger heel graag.

Bolzano, eigenlijk vanmiddag maar het wachten duurde 2 uur dus inmiddels is het al avond. De ervaring was zo SLECHT dat ik google heb gemailed om een mogelijkheid te maken om 0 sterren te geven. En dat is nog zacht uitgedrukt. Ik heb een keer gebeld om te vragen hoe het met mijn bestelling was, toen werd ik erg onvriendelijk te woord gestaan door een vrouw die zei dat het er dadelijk aankomt. Echter duurde het nog 1 uur na het gesprek. Toen de pizza en kapsalon werden bezorgd kwamen wij tot de ontdekking dat alle reviews klopte namelijk: een koude pizza met een te zachte maar toch aangebrande korst. Hierbij kregen we ook nog een cadeautje namelijk een mooie haar van iemand uit de keuken. ( zie afbeelding 2 in het midden). De kapsalon was wel lekker. Maar nadat mijn vriendin een haar vond in haar pizza, heb ik toch iets minder ervan genoten. Ik zou dit restaurant echt ten zeerste afraden. Ik heb in jaren niet meer een in deze mate slechte service en maaltijd gehad. Deze ervaring was rampzalig."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNw526ejbE8KvBV5J1UwHv9TGAJmhYcVoTTDGWv\u0026fid=0x0:0xacd6070b3f0e52c1""],""When"":""2021-7-13""},{""Name"":""epic Rayen070NL-_-"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLzDl91ZTLn78iX5DCBQhOEeci3TS7BWo38hRpMM9HQEk7-QA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Ik wacht 2 uur lang op me pizza en hij is koud\nEn vies slechte service"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Toomfath"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU_sPzthH5lyfkdZjZnBDBNnn2g8nqHU84HwNX7Kivs12CwKgc_=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Een van de slechtste pizza's ooit.

Walls plastered with rock caf√© decor and the chance to request your favourite songs. There's a lounge square in the middle with deep couches, and you'll often find people gathering to play cards.\n\nThe staff is approachable and casual. If you go there often enough, they'll become your friends. Though a little casual: when asked for beer snacks in the form of crisps, we literally got two layes baggies. Good thing we knew how to make a makeshift bowl!\n\nBeer bingo is comical, and all it takes is ordering a few special beers to participate.\n\nIf you have no idea where to go, come see if you're right for this place.

The owner was very friendly and guided us to our table. Recommended to try the Tomahawk stake for 2 people, starting with their delicious mushroom soup. Very tasty, not to salty perfect balance with all the ingredients. The Tomahawk was really delicious with the mix of their pasta.

Food however was mixed. Therefore i am writing the review hopefully to make owners and kitchen aware do they can adapt if wanted. As ut would be a shame if this place is let down by its food. We had several starters and the feedback here is 50/50. Two of them were amazing the other ones were ok but kind of blend. One example was the crab with salad. Sounded very nice on the menu but crab was blend and salad no dressing or very little. On the other hand calamari were amazing and the other dips for the bread too. Scampi on the other hand blend again. Presentation etc. very nice so nothing to change there.\nFor the main the muscles were amazing. Really big im size (the actual muscles, so not taking about the portion size here but portion was generous in case you would like to know. On the other hand our two friends who had different cuts of meats I think one of them was the Brazil one mention again that flavor was blend and sides all tasted the same as the meat. We actually tried it and can confirm this. And again salade not dressed. If you put salad on thrn plate then it needs dressing otherwise it is just leaves... steak Tatar was unfortunately a let down as well. Very blend and the few drops of dressing not enough. Egg was missing.\nOverall still a nice experience as the staff was very very friendly and professional. And again some of the food was very tasty. Moscow Mules were very good too. I wrote the long review because I like the place and the good vibe there so hoping that owner and kitchen do something a out this.

The Chef was having such a good time and I guess he saw me salivating over all the delicious food being made, so he started making a little extra of everything and giving it to me to try while I waited. He even had them bring me a gratis Limoncello, which is my favorite aperitif.

We arrived at 10:50 and there were people sitting still and the full buffet was still out, BUT we were told that breakfast was no longer served. When we objected and told them we had called in advance, the lady went to her colleague to check and that turned out to be the lady we had spoken to on the phone. Surprisingly we were told that breakfast would be served only until 11:00 LITERALLY and that we could not sit down to eat.\n\nWhile I understand that there are rules in place there should be room for exceptions within reason and having us (6 people) sit down to have breakfast would hardly have constituted a problem, but instead the employees choose the ridged interpretation and refused to serve us.

Have a look via Street View at the outside of the Restaurant and decide for yourself. Than: Read the other Reviews here. Not only slow, also very mixed experiences. I had once here a very good Kapsalon. One Time. Out of several. The other times it was in my taste barley eatable. And nobody is kidding with the long delivery time. So, it is more like a Russian roulette to Order here. Sometimes it's good, most times in my experiences it is not. So, why bother and take a risk here? Order directly with a better reviewed Restaurant for your hard earned money and don't be disappointed. ü§¢"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Tiago Alexandre"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWGn3WmSP9CsBrdHqmwhaxq8bixHyUyvjIBYiSbTqI5BWPfbkVh=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""If you think of ordering food here, pls think twice.
